# Normals Rotator #
A tool for efficiently rotating normal maps and their related textures for 2D/3D rendering.

The primary goal is to create a simple tool to rotate normal maps without corrupting the vectors as well as applying that same rotation and transform to related textures. Otherwise, this is a simple demonstration application exercising the capabilities of the Elysium engine.

### Capabilities / Advantages ###
